# **Artefact**

Artist *Mieke Gerritzen* designed this textile piece, called Hero's Scarf, with a pattern created by the repetition of images of all possible modern icons of public figures, such as Mickey Mouse, Nelson Mandela, Marylin Monroe, but also mass murderers like Saddam Hussein, Osama BinLaden and Hitler. The eloquence of the scarf is precisely due to its extensive choice.

## *Mieke's Spectacle*

Mieke Gerritzen designed a scarf with the images of all possible modern icons of public figures, such as Mickey Mouse, Nelson Mandela, Marylin Monroe, but also mass murderers like Saddam Hussein, Osama BinLaden and Hitler. The eloquence of the scarf is precisely due to its extensive choice. This scarf was taken from the range on offer in the museum shop of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam because visitors were offended by the presence of mass murderers on the scarf. Mieke Gerritzen discusses the position of 'controversial art' in a museum (shop). Apparently a museum shop is not a real part of the museum but a purely commercial institution. After a few days the scarf was offered for sale again.<br>
Her work always revolves around exploring the relationship between images and various aspects of contemporary life. Mieke’s work is always thought-provoking and critical towards the way we devour images that are served to us every day of our lives. She often points out the paradox of the abundance of visual material on the one hand, and our illiteracy when it comes to really understanding what we see on the other hand.<br>
> [...] "Yet the most characteristic quality of this new social development may not be the number of images that confronts us but rather our deep need to visualise everything we deem important. We do this en masse, even though most of us aren’t trained to do so."

#### *Iconophilia VS Iconoclasm*
**This is the paradox of iconoclasm: it draws us to the very thing it would destroy, inscribing a story and creating an object that is, in certain respects, richer and more powerful than before.** <br> The toppled monument and the defaced statue strike us with greater force than their integral counterparts, becoming potential sites of reflection but also of emotional response.
There can be so much connected to this topic: the public perception of a "God", the maniac obsession of celebrities, that become icons (in a capitalistic society), the destruction of global heritage by an elite, the manipulation of information throughout time: the disappearing of some and the transformation of others.<br>
Sacred damaged images acquire more symbolical value after the iconoclast intervention; other 'icons' simply disappear. 
The personal subjective perception of 'icons'? How do people see people and why? <br>
Think of this Heroes list's meaning in society, what is the response and what is the interpretation I want to give to it? Can I create my own Heroes' list? Or a list that would function in a utopian parallel universe?

#### ***The Phenomenon of Glorification***
Our beloved Hollywood's Stars and VIPs became these alienating, unquestionable role&life models of who we got used to accept everything, to an extent of envying them and even desiring to become like them. This obsessive way of approaching and look up to these people is cause of spiritual blindness in the majority of the human beings. In the 50's and 60's the yet unknown concept of Stardom was totally blooming!<br>
Le 'Cinéma de niche' opened the doors to a serie of immortal Icons, but it also gave birth to a wave of pathetic clichés such as: 'Look at that guy, yes that with a cigarette, he's so cool', 'A fur makes you look like you're worth a million', and so on and so forth. Personalities and lifestyles of these people started to get all over tv, gaining more and more visibility, becoming what we now call "Icons"; their fashion style, their make up and hair, their habits (good and bad, true and false) were so influential on their audience that within no time they started to make more damage than ever.
<br>There was such a big economical manipulation behind their public figures, there still is nowadays.
Things like furs and cigarettes were boosted in movies and red carpets by the respective industries, destroying the little ethic values that people had and encouraging harmful habits out of something that, at a time when everything was fresh and new, looked 'sexy'.
<br>The depreciation of values like love and respect was much helped by things like reality shows and the impending ease in dealing with a divorce. Divorces became almost a habit and on a daily basis and easier for people to take that decision. Reality shows, with their mad screaming and free violence (both phisical and psychological) created a layer of apathy and detachment and these ways of acting became ways of being, bringing these attitudes up to a daily-basis level.

<details>
<summary>Questions and Reflections</summary>
→ But are all Icons bad? The point is that it is the public that decides; when it comes to straight forward mass murderes or peace makes there is more or less an equal common response but when it comes to Stars there is more of a subtelty to it: it is a process, a long-term one. Mieke calls them "Heroes". <br>
→ What is a hero? It is very subjective: for some people Hitler is a hero and for others he is a murder. <br>
→ What if heroes do not exist? <br>
→ Can there be a shift in the meaning and reception of it? <br>
→ Can the obsession of these icons shift into a realisation of the loss of much more important things? (Native-American massacre should be much more important than Kim Kardashian) <br>
→ Can I address the superficiality/shallowness of people? <br>
→ Also, how do you define the importance of something? Because people give importance to it?<br>
→ Can I relate it to memory?<br>
→ The object is referential to the topic of Stardom<br>
→ How does it open up venues when thinking in other media?<br>
→ Research Why is it, that Archives prioritize content.<br>
→ Mieke made it in her generation of Design Stars >> is it self preservation? <br>
→ Fame in relation to the face (how does recognition works) <br>
→ What is the resilience of someone's face? <br>
→ Who survives the process of recognition and why? <br>
→ Visual spamming? <br>
→ What is this object in relation to the Archive?<br>
→ What is the urgency of the significance of it? <br>
→ What would it be if I had to update the scarf's content?<br>
→ Its position in the archive can bring up many questions? Why is it there? <br>
→ Think of how to work with the Archive, how to traslate the "scarf" into a method or reason in how to work with the archive, think of materiality of it, why textile? Why a scarf?<br>
→ Can I connect nostalgia to these icons?* <br>
*→ Think of the Criteria when classifying these people, who got chosen and who not?<br>
→ List of actions to do when at the archive: tape, pictures, scan...(scent...)<br>
→ Family tree (?) <br>
→ How do we make strategies for things to exist in a longer period of time?<br>
→ How is metadata of scarf collected and catalogued?<br>
→ Create myhtology?<br>
→ Narratives, rituals...<br>
→ Quiz, who is your hero? (given hero like a token)

*Example of Mieke's Design →* 

****The biggest visual power show****

→ 'To be heroes', why are heroes forced to *global visibility*? 
→ Why does Mieke chooses only fame related entrees? 
→ And why does she call them heroes and not 'icons'? 

→ Came across this video called *Versions* by Oliver Laric...

→*Link:*  [https://anthology.rhizome.org/versions](https://anthology.rhizome.org/versions) 

*Versions* is a meta-exploration of the relationship between copy and original, authorship, piracy, and reuse. Ultimately, *Versions* is a celebration of visual culture as a collective, social project, historically and in the internet-enabled present.

...which opened up doors to different approaches.

> Touched with a hammer or a tunin fork, I cook every chant in my pot. It's the real thing.

> Many versions, are different perspectives, of one movable event.

> *Multiplications of an Icon, far from diluting its cultic power, rather increases its fame and each image - however imperfect -conventionally partakes of some portion of the properties of the pre-cursor.*

> Every lie creates a parallel world, the world in which is true.

**>> *KEYWORDS FOR POTENTIAL APPROACHES FOR TRANSCODING (INTERPRETATIVE) <<*
*How can I see these Icons? 
What could they turn into?***

**→ cult/power
→ pre-cursors
→ reproduction/copy/update
→ facial features/recognition
→ historical artifacts
→ rituals/myths**

→ Are 'heroes' and 'celebrities' distortions of reality? Re-edit into One's reality to fit their vision?
→ To which extent do humans project their needs, wishes and goals on other humans? Are humans aware of this projection? If so, how much are they concerned?
→ Where does the limit stands when idolizing? Is idolizing on a global scale fair?
→ Why is there such a bis reaction/opinion on this topic? 
→ How is metadata of scarf collected and catalogued ? 
→ How to approach the source/origin of this artifact?

**→ Fame in relation to the face = How does recognition works?** 

→ WHAT IS THE RESILIENCE OF SOMEONE'S FACE? 

- scientific approach (?)
- links to longevity of historical artifacts;
- compare a person's facial features to the effectivness of artifact's characteristics;
- related to media and reproduction: R*epetition and multiplication consolidates.*
    → CATEGORIZATION OF HEROES

    Mistification and mythification of human figures just like in ancient Greece and Rome, when it was mostly mythology that created heroes.

### **Distinctive features and Facial Recognition**

![](README-images/physiognomy1-articleLarge.jpg)

**→ Fame in relation to the face = How does recognition works?** 

It is helpful in approaching different methods of transcoding when it comes to interpretation and media. 

→ How does facial recognition work? ([https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/opinion/facial-recognition-race.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/opinion/facial-recognition-race.html))

# **Transcoding**

Please include a general description of the role of transcoding in your project. Using the H2 headings below, you can specify individual Transcoding experiments. Think about your motivations in transcoding, and mention the role of tools (also those made during the assignment). This gives some direction to the reader about what they will read in more detail below.

## **Transcoding No. 1**

### **Updated Online Scarf**

I am recreating the scarf in a virtual/digital version, using a scraping tool to keep the pictures of the Icons updated (where possible) according to the current time. Some icons are fictional, archetypal or even object, so there will evolve together with the audience's posts. In the case of still-alive stars and icons, the pictures will 'grow' together with their originals. 

### **Methods**

Description of your methods, documentation of behind-the-scenes processes can go here. Think of the photos and videos you made when visiting the IISG or during captures of your artefact. You can use tools such as [Gifs.com](https://gifs.com/) to generate moving-image thumbnail to link to short videos.Just enough to give a clear overview, before getting into details.

Remember to include the url link to jump to the full media, of course!

### **Tools**

Html, ...

### **Results**

Some of your transcoding experiments may have smaller outcome sketches like images or short video tests. They can go directly within this section. Or maybe this transcoding became a part of the final outcome format. When that is the case, you can simply include a [hyperlink](https://github.com/IMD-Y3-2020/Example/blob/master/README.md#) to the final outcomes in the **Transcoding** section. In the final outcome section below you can embed or explain the final format outcome in detail.

## **Transcoding Tool**

### **Description**

You might have made multiple coding tools during the semester. Or the transcoding tool might be part of a specific transcoding experiment itself. It's up to you to define the linear flow of the Readme. Just like the transcoding of media itself, the coding tool should be well documented. So if you are using a coding tool in your first experiment, include the documentation of the coding tool **before** you include the results, etc.

### **Aims**

Include the main aims or intentions behind making the tool, and what it is used for.

### **Methods**

This includes the coding languages, coding frameworks or libraries, and any platforms or webtools for example.

### **Results**

The coding tool will vary a lot between different students. So depending on the use and type, you may include more or less documentation here.

### **Source Links**

Please include links to the tools, sources etc used during the coding. E.g. the resources used for making your coding tool.

# **Reflection**

You might want to include a section about reflecting on the results of your coding and IMD experiments this semester. It can give additional context before reading the final outcomes below.

# **Outcomes**

This section will be different for each student, depending on how and what is formatted as a final result for the semester assignment. Nevertheless a clear written and documented outcomes is important. So give the appropriate subsections or formats to make this as thorough as possible.

### **Outcome Links**

Here you link to your final assignment outcomes. This could be a website, a video, etc etc. Please include links to the appropriate GitHub folder on your repository where your coding tool is stored.

This is the main way to access your IMD + Coding outcomes for the semester. So its very important that you check for bugs, troubleshoot hyperlink issues, embedded media issues etc. Please make sure you KNOW where each file you use is stored. E.g. If you migrated from Notion markdown into GitHub, its **VERY IMPORTANT** to know that Notion randomly stores images on an Amazon server. It changes those locations all the time. So if your main outcome or documentation is still grabbing those links, **its very likely** they might disappear before collectives. So please have all media and necessary files managed well in your own locations (online or github etc).

# **Conclusion**

You might have a nice conclusive observation to share at the end :)

## **Bibliography**

Of course, as with all research work please include a good bibliography with links, and any references that were used or might give additional depth to the work.

**[1]**: Look at this little referenced footnote over here. You can look up different text formats for referencing books, online articles, films etc.
